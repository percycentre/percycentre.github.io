        The Percy Boys' Club
      </h1>
      <h5 class='padding-16'>
        The Percy Centre, started from humble beginnings as The Percy Boys' Club.
        The club was founded by Godfrey Plumbridge and Jack Wotton in 1940 and was
        originally held in the boiler house of the Percy Congregational Chapel
        (now the Elim Penticostal Church) on Charlotte Street.
        The club encouraged boys to take up boxing and table tennis as a way to
        keep them entertained and out of trouble.
      </h5>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        By 1947 the club had moved to the Corn Market on Walcot Street, and its activities
        had expanded to include cricket football teams.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        The club then moved to the old school building on Monmouth place.
        This school was part of the Wesleyan Chapel on New King Street. The
        foundation stone for this chapel was laid by John Wesley
        (founder of the Methodist Movement) in 1777. Sadly, the Chapel was destroyed
        by bombing during the Baedecker raids of 1942. The club continued to grow
        undeterred, and developed plans to create a purpose build club on the
        former site of the chapel.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        In 1962 the new £27,000 premises were opened by Field Marshal Lord Harding of Petherton.
        The new building was funded by subscriptions and a grant from the Ministry of Education.
        Enrolment fees at this time were 1s 6d and the weekly subscription was also 1s 6d for
        working members - but only 9d for those still at school. The new premises
        included a large gym, a drama stage, library, lounge and canteen, as well
        as changing and hobby rooms.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        By 1965 The club was the biggest in the wast with 300 members and more than
        500 associates. It also provided a community centre for over 100 elderly people.
        The Percy Boys' Club celebrated their silver anniversary year during this year,
        with a bronze plaque which was unveiled by the Mayor of bath, Cllr. George Mayer;
        which still has pride of place at the main entrance to this day.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        In 1984 The local authority withdrew grant funding, feeling that the site was underused.
        It was suggested that the Boys' Club should use part of an alternative site in Odd Down.
        Many public figures, including MP Chris Patten and Major John Lyons, came out in support
        of the Club. Over 300 people signed a petition to reverse the authority's decision.
        As a result, it was agreed that a smaller grant of £39,20 would be paid to sustain a
        reduced programme of activities untl March 1985.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        By 1990 The Club was again threatened with closure, after a further review from Avon
        County Council of the clubs activities found that the Club was not being well used.
      </p>

      <h5 class='padding-16'>
        In 1992 however, the building was refurbished by Avon County Council
        and instead re-opened as The Percy Community Centre we know today,
        providing facilities and activities for the whole community.
