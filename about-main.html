      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <h5 class='padding-16'>
        The Percy Centre, started from humble beginnings as The Percy Boys' Club
        in the boiler house of the Percy Congregational Chapel
        (now the Elim Penticostal Church) in Charlotte Street, founded by
        Godfrey Plumbridge and Jack Wotton in 1940.
      </h5>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        By 1947 the cliub had moved to the Corn Market on walcot street, and its activities
        had expanded to include a cricket team and football team, as well as the Boxing and Table-tennis
        that had made up the sum total of the groups activities before that.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        The club then moved to the old school building on Monmouth place. This school was part
        of the Wesleyan Chapel on New King Stree. The foundation stone for this chapel was laid
        by John Weley (founder of the Methodist Movement) in 1777. Sadly, the Chapel was destroyed
        by bombing during the Baedecker raids of 1942. The club continued to grow and developed
        plans to create a purpose build club on the former site of the chapel.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        In 1962 the new £27,000 premises were opened by Field Marshal Lord Harding of Petherton.
        The new building was funded by subscriptions and a grant from the Ministry of Education.
        Enrolment fees at this time were 1s 6d and the weekly subscription was also 1s 6d for
        working members and 9d for those still at school. The new premises included a large gym,
        a drama stage, library, lounge and canteen, as well as changing rooms and hobby rooms.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        By 1965 The club was the biggest in the wast with 300 members and more than 500 associates.
        It also provided a community centre for over 100 elderly people. The Percy Boys' Club
        celebrated their silver anniversary year during this year, with a bronze plaque which was
        unveiled by the Mayor of bath, Cllr. George Mayer;
        which still has pride of place at the main entrance to this day.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        In 1984 The local authority withdrew grant funding, feeling that the site was underused.
        It was suggested that the Boys' Club used part of an alternative site in Odd Down.
        Many public figures, including MP Chris Patten and Major John Lyons, came out in support
        of the Club. Over 300 people signed a petition to reverse the authority's decision.
        As a result, it was agreed that a smaller grant of £39,20 would be paid to sustain a
        reduced programme of activities untl March 1985.
      </p>

      <p class='text-grey'>
        By 1990 The Club was again threatened with closure, after a further review from Avon
        County Council reviewed the clubs activities and found that the Club was not being well
        used.
      </p>

      <h5 class='padding-16 bold'>
        In 1992 The building was refurbished by Avon County Council and re-opened as The Percy
        Community Centre we know today, providing facilities and activities for the whole community.
